# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE: 12.02.2020**
* **ASSISTANTS: Marta Cortes Orduna**

### Minutes

According to feedback, there are no major issues that are required to change.
Two key points has been highlighted that should be noted though:
    1.	It has been mentioned that in the first section, describe the RESTful API, we should include some information about the   
        advantages of our API. We should aim to sell our API towards clients. Therefore, a bit more information should be presented in 
        order to do the marketing for our web API.  2.	Regarding the resources, it has been suggested to ensure minimum five resources         are available for our API. As according to our provided diagram there are more than five resources, so it is advised we can make         changes lately if we are not able to implement all the described resources.


### Action points

Considering the feedback, we would be working on these concerns and make the required changes.
